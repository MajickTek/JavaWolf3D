# JavaWolf3D
Simple Wolfenstein 3D-style engine in Java

# Instructions
Use the makefile to build and run the program.

make all is to build and run it.

Make jar is to build an executable jar file.

make clean is to remove the class files and the jar.

Keep in mind that the res folder MUST be in the same place as the jar (it is not put inside the jar during build).
