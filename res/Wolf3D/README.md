Wolfenstein 3D Textures

Even though the game is obsolete, these textures are still copyrighted.

I got them from http://lodev.org/cgtutor/files/wolftex.zip .

lodev.org has a great raycasting tutorial for c++/SDL.

I don't actually use these textures in the engine right now, but i probably will later.
