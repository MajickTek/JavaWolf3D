Tiled CSV

# Creating CSV in Tiled

Create a new map. Name it whatever you want, and change the size to whatever you want. 

The "layer style" does not matter right now but i just have it set to CSV.

Add your tileset/images. By default, the CSV exporter uses the tile IDs as the "spaces" in the file, with -1 being empty space.

To change this, give each of your tiles a "name" property (with a string value of whatever).

Go to File | Export As and choose CSV.

Done!
